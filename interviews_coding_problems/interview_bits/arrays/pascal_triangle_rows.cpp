/*
  Given numRows, generate the first numRows of Pascalâ€™s triangle.

  Questions
  - what if k rows do not fit into memory?
  you should calculate that and throw an exception. This case is improbable since the primitive
  data types will upper bound k tighter. Unless a different data type is used this shouldn't
  be considered. It's more easy than that. Usually vector will give some hint or malloc will fail.
  - what if k is negative?
  throw an exception.
  - is it 0 or 1 based?
  assume is 0 based.
  - what if the value of the max number of row k is not representable with ull?
  throw an exception.

  Optimizations
  - allocate all the space at the beginning since it can be calculated.

  Test cases
  - k < 0 || k > overflow --> throw exception
  - k > memory size
  - k > representable
