Given a binary tree where all the right nodes are either leaf nodes with a sibling (a left node that shares the same parent node) or empty, flip it upside down and turn it into a tree where the original right nodes turned into left leaf nodes. Return the new root.

For example:
Given a binary tree {1,2,3,4,5},
    1
   / \
  2   3
 / \
4   5
return the root of the binary tree [4,5,2,#,#,3,1].
